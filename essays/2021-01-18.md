With the rapid development of today's information technology, many jobs need them to operate, such as setting up web security system, editing web pages, creating web pages, and organizing and storing information are all needed information technology. It was in the last semester that I decided to double major in MIS, because I was interested in building websites and computer programs. Secondly, I think MIS is paired well with finance major, regard as most of financial analysis data need to use information technology-base. Additionally, I think MIS is extremely interesting, because I can use my programming knowledge to create something new to web page, which is innovative and fulfilling. Of course that MIS not only has programming content, there are more interesting contents waiting for me to learn. Overall, I think this major will have great development in the future career. 

The reason why I take ITM 352 is that it is a required course for the first section of MIS Major. I took ICS 101 and BUS 311 before which I totally enjoy to editing and creating in the program.  Since coding is more harder, I will put more efforts and time on it, and hope that I can learn a lot in this class.
