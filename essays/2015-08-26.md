It was in the last semester that I decided to double major in MIS, because I was interested in building websites and computer programs. Secondly, with the continuous innovation of technology, many jobs in the future will use information technology to operate and manage information, so I think this major will also have great development in the future career. The reason why I take ITM 352 is that it is a required course for the first section of MIS Major.
